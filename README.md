# Touchpaint Flutter

This is a simple Flutter app for latency testing and comparison to the [Touchpaint Linux kernel module](https://github.com/kdrag0n/touchpaint) and [native Android app](https://github.com/kdrag0n/touchpaint-android). Available modes include:

- Paint with finger (for testing drag latency)
- Fill screen on touch (for testing tap latency)
- Box follows touch (for testing drag latency differently, similar to this [Microsoft Research video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOvQCPLkPt4))
- Blank redraw (for testing baseline rendering performance)
